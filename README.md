`Map your knowledge and find best learning path using the knowledge graph`

Knowledge Graph is an educational startup that is built on the concept of representing knowledge as a graph, where nodes represent concepts or topics, and edges represent relationships between them. The platform aims to provide a personalized learning experience to learners of all ages, from kindergarten to adulthood. For example you should know addition before you learn multiplication. And in fact any knowledge in the world can be represented like this.

The startup's platform offers a comprehensive knowledge graph that covers a wide range of subjects and topics. Each node in the graph contains a tiny chunk of knowledge that is easy to understand and learn. The platform leverages the power of videos, shorts, texts, assignments and tests to provide a comprehensive learning experience for users.
